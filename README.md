**Project Details**

In this repository, I have utilized various features of Pandas for data analysis, including:

***Extracting desired rows and columns**

***Indexing**

***Sorting**

***Filtering data**

***Performing mathematical and statistical functions**

Additionally, I have incorporated the **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** libraries to visualize the survey data. The visualizations include:

Line plots for **sin**, **cos**, and **tan** functions.

**Bar chart** showing the average responses from the survey data
